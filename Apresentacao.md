O que vamos fazer
-- Santiago

- Using reiforcement learning to play kung fu chess
- Kung fu is a real-time variant of chess where there are no turns, so any player that can move as many pieces as they want, just as long as you do not move the same piece twice within a small time frame
- We will need to implement kung fu chess

-- Joao
- Implement an RL framework, most likely from scratch because of the specificities that this game requires (two adversarial agents paying at the same time in the same board)

----------------- slide 2 ---------------------

- Relate this project with va project, and compare this apporach of using RL with the ones used in GA
- Analyse it from a teorietical point of view and a pratical one
